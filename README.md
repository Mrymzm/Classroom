# CSS Practice 

Practicing level 1 and 2 of CSS. This includes the three different styles of applying styling to HTML structure. Including style tag in the head tag, Inline CSS and External stylesheet. I applied style by giving unique id and classes to the HTML tags. 

### Practiced:
- Making a navbar.
- Changing color, font and alignment of text.
- Line-hight, font-weight, text-align.
- Making div's boxes, making circles.
- Trying different border styling.
- Adding links and text-decoration.
- styling buttons.
- Unordered list.

## 🚀 Features
- `index.html` - Includes main skeleton of website.

- `.gitignore` - Includes the metadata about how Finder displays that folder — like icon positions, window size, and view settings.
